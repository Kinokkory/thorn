Datatype Manipulation with Template Haskell

http://hackage.haskell.org/package/thorn

Thorn is a datatype manipulation library, implemented using Template Haskell. It's uploaded in Hackage and you can install it with Cabal.

It generates

* functors from various kinds of datatypes, regardless of its arity or variances.

* folds and unfolds from various kinds of recursive datatypes, including mutually recursive ones.

A single function of Thorn will give you a lot. Just try it.
